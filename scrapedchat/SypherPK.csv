serliam: OMEGALUL PEX
leeo_55: avengers endgame to the end
themysticmysfyt: Apex is a good game guys relax
waxorchard: so far i'm underwhelmed, feels like realm royale without the chickens and horsies
callmekayos: apex has no content lulul
kidmd1: c'mon chat he's having fun, that's why I watch, not for the game
1hp_gars: apex trashhhhh
reclutched: it looks hard to cool people wtf lol
zenzupie: hunterea05 knows you better than yourself.
lazzmatazz: I really like the look of combat in this but the "environment" is kind of bland and colorless
thesharkdrummer: Apex a doo doo game
reclutched: kill* people*
leeo_55: watch avengers endgame to the end
mrsavagexx: @absolute_emu Does every skill last a certain amount of time? Like it seems that ice spell stays a long while then melts to water
thesharkdrummer: Rather watch paint dry than play apex
jakeisdying: The environment makes it reeeally hard to pick people out from it
eviltoaster: let streamers play what they want eviltoRiot
goldenngirll: !pet

chimp1: rotfl
arctic_1020: this game is really skilled based
1hp_gars: @sypherpk litterly everyone "WiLl tHiS bE oN cOnSoLe
almightypacko: how do I play ???
callmekayos: if you run tempest, you can be immune to tornados and use them to launch yourself, imo wind gauntlet is one of the best guantlets in the game
eayzzn: @Arctic_1020 yes, hard to hit ppl
oigxbambam: @hunterea05 wait are you streaming in here or is sypher cause im pretty sure he is old enough to pick what he wants to play
jedicat1989: Magic looks coool
absolute_emu: @Mrsavagexx Not all of them, the stone only last if it is cast through flame and it ignites the shockwave on the ground. It's different for each one though
eayzzn: @almightypacko Look in the EpicStore
callmekayos: synergized with tempest ofc
lucas_g5: He's not really looking at chat much
mrsavagexx: @flanabumpsb Agreed, imagine getting one shot left and right In a game with spells

saint_rai: try to use Q before swapping gaunlets
waxorchard: @42xX no it's like trap king
ahmadlhb: So this game is a battle royal but with powers ? Am confused
mrsavagexx: @absolute_emu Do you think a wind gauntlet move that would let you move side to side mid air would be too op or too skill reliant to be worth it
phoennixtsu: @SypherPK cast speed = king of stats in this game atm so in general cast speed > mana amulets etc
flanabumpsb: windjumping efficiently just takes time, i usually rely on audio cues
callmekayos: cracjshot op
marwynsb: ye much better it will get smoother in time
almightypacko: @imrotate not yet, they are going to release it console tho
callmekayos: not op but its pretty good

flanabumpsb: this game is absolutely nothing like fortnite
snarkykitty: lol your reaction
ninjaknight24: toxic
proletariat_gordon: He was hitting you with love
drytoast__: melts up close
callmekayos: @SypherPK experiment with elemental combos, the combos allow you to put out alot more damage
kalenore: Pog gordon
blufloosb: Dextrous amulet is so annoying to go up against lol
birkski: that reaction to dying hahaha
marwynsb: toxic its like a shotgun
draingoe: another stream sniper, sad life
eviltoaster: Yeah the Toxic gauntlet does tons of damage close range and doesn't make as much sound
insti2cija: as a Harry Potter and WoW fan i can say that this is so fucking good
alsen74: Toxic its the shotgun of the game
themysticmysfyt: @susboy_69 and i fail to see how this is in anyway similar to fortnite
calyzz: he had a gold scar
proletariat_gordon: @almightypacko we'll have a Q&A live stream this week
ca_glimps: this game is so trash

theeddcase: Toxic gauntlet basically a shotgun
almightypacko: poggers
spellbreakman: @SypherPK Toxic sorcery + fireball is mad
absolute_emu: @SypherPK Toxic, think the old double barrel in fortnite
susboy_69: its a worse version of fortnite
richrdkt: Did you enjoyed Game of thrones
aphsings: yeah toxic is pretty much the shotgun of the game
maggz2019: you got this next round
blufloosb: @SypherPK He had dextrous amulet that increased your cast speed by 30%
kessarean: @susboy_69 do you know anything about this gams? Ironic as well since fortnite ripped off pubg, who ripped off h1z1. Even then, it’s not so much a rip off as a new genre. BRs are what’s popular
superbatr: Holy mother of lot xD
lucas_g5: @SypherPK thanks so much for explaining the game earlier you're amazing
syncadesb: facts btw
kashkow: Sypher you are one of my favourite streamers ❤️
eviltoaster: Yeah close range gets risky because you can get stuck in stat check fights like you say
susboy_69: this game is exactly the same as fn
plutotheslayer21: I am not a champion I can't watch
proletariat_gordon: hahahah
eviltoaster: especially if you get in the air because of hovering
woolsundew: is this game on xbox
1hp_gars: funny

woolsundew: cypher is it
absolute_emu: @SypherPK only happens if you cast on the way up, not the way down
superwinbroz: Poison
woolsundew: cypher
superwinbroz: Crack shot with poison.
1hp_gars: @SypherPK BTW @Proletariat_Gordon Is the ceo of spellbreak
eviltoaster: @SypherPK if you delay a shot after hovering in the air, you can fast fall instead of staying still in the air holding left click. It's really important for avoiding those stat check fights
blufloosb: EVERYONE GO CABBAGE FARMER
eviltoaster: sorry if I'm backseating eviltoCreep

samurai_jd: How many games have you played so far?
susboy_69: this is literally fortnite without the building
eviltoaster: The way your mana regenerates, if you shoot one shot but delay your next shot, you'll regen to max mana so you never have to reload, but you have less DPS. It's important if you're gonna clash projectiles mid air though
flanabumpsb: time your 10 second 30% damage boost with your strongest gauntlet @SypherPK
