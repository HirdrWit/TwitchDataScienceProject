fancy_pants_tv: dk what should i do to gain fallowers
sugarblaze22: sorry
kelevra2k: what happened DK was so upbeat playing lava mode before!

nightbot: khaleesi2393 hugs @dakotaz
chrismariotv: Is that the real MillerDC ?
justdontp4nic: @MassageCreep it was a troll lol
mank_lfg: @dakotaz arena is just matching you up with players that are a similar skill level. I know you're frustrated but imagine an "average" player running into you on pubs and getting destroyed lol. They probably feel like you're "sweaty". I agree tho...game is in a weird place
elpws: @dakotaz Do you think people hate this game because people are getting good? lol
ovechkin8797: @dakotaz is blackout better?
itsmeeeks: shield for kills was such a great thing they added
millerdc: Do u think Epic will do something about it
drkozmoz: The game was in a good state 3 days ago.
notordinary44: definitely agree with you
sugarblaze22: Heard that
dockingstark: you ever heard the expression 'you can polish a turd' Epic made this game bad but you're still making the most of it I admire that.
ballislife13: I already stopped i played 2 yestereday and was OVER IT
massagecreep: @JustDontP4nic haha okay thanks!

kranzeon: im back
jasem7865: Dk literally after everyone came back and they got everything back they do the wrong stuff like why
itsmeeeks: even if they said it made for more aggressive tactics they could have just reduced it to 25 health/shield or something
justdontp4nic: Agreed lava was the only good part of the new update
dockingstark: you ever heard the expression 'you can polish a turd' Epic made this game bad but you're still making the most of it I admire that.
ovechkin8797: @dakotaz what game will you play when it happens tho?
kmbgeneral: the sharks? come ooooooon brother! i'll give you the other two but i think the east has got more talent in 3 teams than the entire west
thephunkphenomenon: It seems like they just listened to their community until Apex was out of the picture. Feels bad man
sugarblaze22: what game is next?
notordinary44: same reason why i quit fortnite
dg_1533: I hope they change it back next update
willyyxl: @dakotaz your stream brother do what you like
